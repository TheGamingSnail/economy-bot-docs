# Automated Features

### Daily Talent Points Distribution
- Talent points are distributed daily at 12:00 PM GMT based on member participation. Member participation is counted based on how many clan members ran `/clan talent_points claim`, which is then used as a percentage of the total clan members to figure out how many talent points to give out. The max amount of talent points a clan can receive at once is 5.

### Elections
- Elections automatically recur every 7 days if a general is removed.

### Battle System
- Includes troop strength calculations, tile bonuses, and random casualties.
